# CS255

    The theme of the two projects in this class centered around the DriverPass project, designed to help a hypothetical business 
manage its driver's license trainees using a web-based system.  The client needed a system to manage their educational
service which included online classes and tests, scheduling of driving appointments, paying for learning packages, and reporting 
features.  The client expected the system to grow with the company, and required database and security services be cloud-based.  
I think that I performed well in preparing the designs found in the System Design document.  They are clear and thorough, and 
accurately portray the major use cases, activities, sequences, and objects/classes included in the system based on the requirements 
from the Business Requirements document.
    If I were to improve one thing in these documents, I could streamline the user permissions list under "Objectives and Goals" in 
order that other sections of the project could serve as the documentation for them, such as the Use Case diagram.  These user 
permissions are implied in the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements sections.
    The users' needs were interpreted from the interview with the hypothetical owner of the company early in the course, from which 
the majority of requirements were discovered.  These guided the design of the system from the earliest stage, as I deemed certain 
needs as being more universal among users.  The ability to restrict access to registered users was one of the most fundamentally-
required capabilities of the system, so that user activities were traceable to the individuals involved.  This also served to protect 
the value of the educational material found on the website so that non-students could not benefit from this intellectual property.
Certain requirements were more effective in meeting the business goals of the system, such as being available remotely via the 
internet, which required the flexibility to adapt to various screen sizes found on computers, tablets, and smartphones.  Also, connect-
ivity ensured that data exchange and storage is synchronized among all users in real time.  An understanding of the users' needs was 
crucial when designing the system in order to facilitate a high degree of engagement.  The quality of the educational program hosted 
inside the DriverPass system had the possibility of being either enhanced or diminished according to the ease of use of the system. 
There could be nothing worse for me as a systems analyst to be blamed for poor student retention due to a confusing or error-prone 
system.  
    My approach to designing software is lead by the requirement that it work efficiently for the user.  To accomplish this, a use 
case must be accomplished in as few clicks and steps as possible.  It must also provide the gratification of positive feedback for the 
user so that they can immediately see that their particular actions within the use case have been successful by highlighting changes
in interface appearance or behavior in various ways, like a changed shadowing of the font or button, or colorizing, or animated forms 
of feedback.  Responsivity in all forms must be maintained to keep the user's attention and minimize frustration and wandering to a 
different open program.  Regarding the back end, the more the system follows the object-oriented principles of encapsulation, port-
ability, inheritance, and polymorphism, the easier it is to troubleshoot and update.  Since so much time is spent reading and maintain-
ing code, it must be well-documented so that efforts can focus on locating the problem using a "map" of the software, which is the 
documentation.  Documentation is superior to jumping straight into coding as well, even with the automatic documentation available
now, because it can be used to present plans to non-experts and to gain their agreement on how to move forward with development.  
Documentation is also a superior way to "take notes" in a structured manner, while also being iterable.
